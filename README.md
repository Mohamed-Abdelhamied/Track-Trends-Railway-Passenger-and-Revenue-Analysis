# Track-Trends-Railway-Passenger-and-Revenue-Analysis
The Track Trends project is designed to offer an in-depth analysis of railway data to identify patterns related to passenger flow, ticket pricing, and revenue generation. By utilizing SQL for data querying and aggregation, the project aims to detect significant travel behavior trends and ticket sales patterns across various railway stations. To complement this data analysis, Power BI and Tableau are employed to create comprehensive journey reports, leveraging DAX for advanced calculations and insightful visualizations.

Main Objectives:
The primary goal of the project is to gain actionable insights from railway data, focusing on the following aspects:

Passenger Flow Analysis:

Analyzing passenger volume between different stations to identify both highly frequented and less crowded routes.

Understanding travel behavior through the number of passengers per station pair.

Ticket Price Analysis:

Calculating the average ticket price for each route to understand pricing structures.

Identifying pricing trends based on travel distance and demand, helping optimize fare strategies.

Cancellation and Delay Analysis:

Investigating the root causes of trip cancellations and delays to enhance service reliability.

Developing data-backed solutions to minimize interruptions and improve punctuality.

Revenue Insights:

Summarizing revenue generated per station pair to pinpoint the most lucrative routes.

Analyzing revenue distribution to optimize resource allocation and ticket pricing strategies.

Performance Metrics:

Categorizing journey times (Same Day, 1-3 Days, 4-7 Days, 8-14 Days, More Than 14 Days) to assess travel patterns.

Correlating ticket prices with journey durations to identify cost-efficient travel options.

Data Sources:
Fact Table: railway (ticket and transaction details).

Dimension Tables:

Station: Holds station IDs and names.

Date, Time, Trip, Ticket, Payment: Contextual data for comprehensive analysis.

Technologies Used:
SQL: Extracting, cleaning, and aggregating data.

Power BI and Tableau: Creating visualizations to represent passenger trends, pricing analysis, and revenue insights.

Python (optional): Data cleaning and preprocessing before visualization.

Expected Outcomes:
The project is expected to deliver data-driven insights into railway passenger patterns, helping to visualize ticket pricing trends and revenue allocation. By identifying profitable routes and analyzing the causes of delays and cancellations, the project will offer actionable recommendations to enhance pricing strategies and improve railway service efficiency. This structured analysis will support decision-making for railway management by providing clear and insightful reports.
